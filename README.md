# Aligent AWS microservices template using Typescript and Serverless Framework

A template for developing a suite of AWS microservices using Typescript and [AWS CDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/home.html).

The monorepo workspace is managed using [Nx.](https://nx.dev)

## Setup

1. Update application name in `package.json`.

   It's recommend to have the name in the format of: `@<brand-name>-int/integrations`

   Example: `@aligent-int/integrations`

2. Install dependencies: `yarn install`

   You may need to run `nvm use` to ensure you're on a compatible version of NodeJS

3. (Optional) Bootstrap SSM parameters:

   ```bash
   # Copy the example template
   cp ./applications/core/config/.env.example.json ./applications/core/config/.env.json

   # Setup required SSM parameters for your environment
   yarn pg:parameters
   ```

## Services

Services are the core components deployed to AWS by the application

[Add a service](#‚≠ê-adding-a-new-service) | [Test app](#üß™-testing-the-application) | [Deploy app](#üöÄ-playground-deploy-of-the-application) | [Clean up app](#üóëÔ∏è-clean-up-the-application-from-playground) | [Remove a service](#‚ùå-removing-a-service) | [Mock Endpoints](#üß™-testing-with-mock-services)

### ‚≠ê Adding a new service

Services are generated by our `@tools/cdk-service-plugin`. It supports generating CDK-based services using predefined templates and executors as described below.

```bash
yarn nx g cdk-service
# You will be prompted to:
# 1. Enter the service name
# 2. Select the service type (general or notification)
```

Import and instantiate it in `applications/core/lib/create-application-stacks.ts`:

```typescript
import { YourServiceStack } from '@services/your-service-name';

export function createApplicationStacks(scope: Construct, _stage: string, props?: StageProps) {
  new YourServiceStack(this, 'your-service-name', {
    ...props,
    description: 'Your service description',
  });
}
```

---

### üß™ Testing the application

After adding a new service, test the application:

```bash
yarn lint        # Lint affected projects
yarn test        # Run tests for affected projects
yarn check-types # Type check affected projects
```

By default, Nx will only test code impacted by recent changes to save time. Post-fixing with `:all` will test the whole repository, not just recently affected parts

```bash
yarn test:all
```

---

### üöÄ Playground deploy of the application

Deploy the `dev` stage of your application to your `playground` AWS Profile:

```bash
yarn playground:deploy
# You may be prompted to confirm deployment of changes
```

If you just want to check the CDK compilation process without deploying, use `yarn playground:synth`.

If you need more control, arbitrary CDK commands can be run using the application project

```bash
yarn nx run application:cdk list prd/**
```

---

### üóëÔ∏è Clean up the application from playground

During normal development CDK will remove resources that are no longer used by your application.

If necessary, the entire application can be removed from the account associated with your `playground` AWS profile:

```bash
yarn playground:destroy
# You will be prompted to confirm deletion of the stacks
```

---

### ‚ùå Removing a service

Always remove services using the Nx generator

```bash
yarn nx g remove <service-name>
```

You may need to remove imports of the service from the application first

### üß™ Testing with Mock Services

The application may include mock services for testing integrations without external dependencies

To switch between mock and real dependencies, change the value of the relevant url SSM Parameter.

## Libraries

Libraries are located in the `libs` folder.

General libraries are generated by the `@nx/js` plugin. For more information, check out their [document](https://nx.dev/packages/js)

API client libraries should be generated by the `@aligent/openapi-plugin`

[General library](#‚≠ê-adding-a-new-library) | [API Client](#üîå-adding-a-new-api-client) | [Remove a service](#‚ùå-removing-a-library)

### ‚≠ê Adding a new library

```bash
# Generates a non-buildable library with eslint, vitest
# Lives in a subfolder of 'libs'
# Import path defaults to @<brand-name>/<library-name>
yarn nx g library libs/<library-name>  --importPath=libs/<library-name>
```

---

### üîå Adding a new API client

```bash
yarn nx g client --name=<client-name> --schemaPath=<path-to-openapi-spec>
```

### ‚ùå Removing A Library

Always remove libraries using the Nx generator

```bash
yarn nx g remove <library-name>
```

You may need to remove imports of the library from the codebase first

## Working with Nx

## General commands

Below are some example of general Nx. commands. For more information, check out their [document](https://nx.dev/packages/nx/documents).

- Remove a service or library:

  `yarn nx g rm <project-name>`

- To run executors (`lint`, `test`, etc..) for all the projects:

  `yarn nx run-many -t <list-of-executors-separated-by-space-or-comma>`

- To run executors for only affected projects:

  `yarn nx affected -t <list-of-executors-separated-by-space-or-comma>`

### Troubleshooting

Reset all Nx project dependencies and caching: `yarn nx reset`

Ensure typescript project references are correct: `yarn nx sync`

Run test, lint, typecheck on all code without caching: `yarn lint:all --skip-nx-cache` etc.

### Notes

- This monorepo uses the new Nx [Typescript Project References setup](https://nx.dev/blog/typescript-project-references). This currently doesn't allow extending tsconfigs at all, so we are not extending `@aligent/ts-code-standard/tsconfigs-base`
- Following `@aligent/ts-code-standard`, we switched to the new [Eslint's FlatConfig](https://eslint.org/blog/2022/08/new-config-system-part-2/). If you're using [VSCode's Eslint extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint), turn on the `eslint.useFlatConfig` setting.
